    <h1 class="head text-center">QSIPL PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
    <p class="para">When you use our services, you trust us with your information. We understand this is a big responsibility and work hard to protect your information and put you in control. This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what information we collect, why we collect it, and how you can update, manage, export, and delete your information.<br>
        We have services that help millions of people daily to explore and get a solution with the world in new ways. Our services include:
        </p><br>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p class="para">
                    AMC
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p class="para">
                Distribution
            </p>
             </li>
             </ul>
    <p class="para">You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a QSIPL Account if you want to create and manage content or see more relevant search results. And you can use many QSIPL services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on QSIPL or placing orders. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control what we collect and how your information is used.</p><br><br>

    <h3>We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services </h3>
    <p class="para">We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you'll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which product you might like. The information QSIPL collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls. When you're not signed in to a QSIPL Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you're using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity. When you're signed in, we also collect information that we store with your QSIPL Account, which we treat as personal information</p><br>

    
    <h3>Things you create or provide to us
        
    </h3>
    <p class="para">When you create a QSIPL Account, you provide us with personal information that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a phone number or payment information to your account. Even if you aren't signed in to a QSIPL Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to receive updates about our services.<br>
        We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services. This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on remark.
       </p><br><br>
       <h3>Information we collect as you use our services <br>
        Your apps, browsers & devices
        
       </h3>
    <p class="para">We collect information about the apps, browsers, and devices you use to access QSIPL services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low. <br>
        The information we collect includes unique identifiers, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your request. <br>
        We collect this information when a QSIPL service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you're using an Android device with QSIPL apps, your device periodically contacts QSIPL servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your device type and carrier name, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings, other information about how you're using your Android device.
        
       </p><br><br>
       <h3 class="sub-head">Your activity </h3>

            </p>
            <h3 class="sub-head">Your location Information</h3>
            <p class="para">
 We collect information about your location when you use our services, which help us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your general location.<br>
•	Your location can be determined with varying degrees of accuracy by: <br>
•	GPS and other sensor data from your device<br>
•	IP address<br>
•	Activity on QSIPL services, such as your searches and places you label like home or work<br>
•	Information about things near your device, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth enabled devices.<br>
</p><br>

<h3 class="sub-head">Maintain & improve our services </h3><br>
    <p class="para">We also use your information to ensure our services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to make improvements to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
    </p><br>

    
<h3 class="sub-head">Communicate with you </h3><br>
<p class="para">We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your QSIPL Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact QSIPL, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
</p><br>

<h3 class="sub-head">Protect QSIPL, our users, and the public  </h3><br>
<p class="para">We use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm QSIPL, our users, or the public.<br>
    We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services.<br> And we analyze your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use algorithms to recognize patterns in data. For example, QSIPL Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.<br>
    We may combine the information we collect among our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, if you watch Dell laptop or searched for AMC, you might see an ad for DELL laptops or lessons on AMC on site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve <br>
    QSIPL’s services and the ads delivered by QSIPL. If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible QSIPL Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify you active online & may get in touch with you via different mode, for example. We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.
   
</p><br>
<h3 class="sub-head">When QSIPL shares your information  </h3><br>
<p class="para">We do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of QSIPL except in the following cases: 
</p><br>
<h3 class="sub-head">With your consent </h3>
<p class="para">We'll share personal information outside of QSIPL when we have your consent. For example, if you use QSIPL Home to make a reservation through a booking service, we'll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with others. We'll ask for your explicit consent to share any sensitive personal information.</p>
