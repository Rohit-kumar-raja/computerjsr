    <h1 class="head">What's covered in these terms?</h1>

    <h2 class="subhead">We know it’s tempting to skip these Terms of Service, but it's important to establish what you can expect from us as you use QSIPL services, and what we expect from you</h2>
    <p class="para">These Terms of Service reflect the way QSIPL’s business works, the laws that apply to our company, and certain things we’ve always believed to be true. As a result, these Terms of Service help define QSIPL’s relationship with you as you interact with our services. For example, these terms include the following topic headings     </p><br>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p class="para">
                    AMC
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p class="para">
                Distribution
            </p>
             </li>
             </ul>
    
    <h3>We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services </h3>
    <p class="para">We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you'll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which product you might like. The information QSIPL collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls. When you're not signed in to a QSIPL Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you're using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity. When you're signed in, we also collect information that we store with your QSIPL Account, which we treat as personal information</p><br>

    
    <h3>Age requirements     
    </h3>
    <p class="para">If you're under the <a href="#">age required to manage your own QSIPL Account,</a> you must have your parent or legal guardian's permission to use a QSIPL Account. Please have your parent or legal guardian read these terms with you.
        If you're a parent or legal guardian, and you allow your child to use the <a href="#">services,</a> then these terms apply to you and you're responsible for your child's activity on the services.
        Some QSIPL services have additional age requirements as described in their <a href="#">service-specific additional terms and policies.</a>
         </p><br><br>

       <h3>Your relationship with QSIPL       
       </h3>
    <p class="para">These terms help define the relationship between you and QSIPL. Broadly speaking, we give you permission to use our services if you agree to follow these terms, which reflect how QSIPL's business works and how we earn money. When we speak of “QSIPL,” “we,” “us,” and “our,” we mean QSIPL LLC and its affiliates, excluding any local entities based in India.        
       </p><br><br>
       <h3 class="sub-head">What you can expect from us</h3>
    <p class="para">Provide a broad range of useful services<br>
        We provide a broad range of services that are subject to these terms, including: 
                </p><br>
                    
                   <p class="para">
                    •	apps and sites (like AMC and Distribution)<br>
                    •	platforms (like QSIPL online services)<br>                   
            </p>
            <p class="para">
                Our services are designed to work together, making it easier for you to move from one activity to the next. 
            </p>
            <h3 class="sub-head">What we expect from you</h3>
            <h3>Follow these terms and service-specific additional terms</h3>
            <p class="para">
                The permission we give you to use our services continues as long as you comply with:<br>
                •	these terms<br>
                •	service-specific additional terms, which could, for example, include things like additional age requirements
                </p><br>

    <p class="para">We also make various policies, help centers, and other resources available to you to answer common questions and to set expectations about using our services. These resources include our Privacy Policy, Copyright Help Center, Safety Center, and other pages accessible from our policies site.<br><br>
        Although we give you permission to use our services, we retain any intellectual property rights we have in the services
        <br>
        We want to maintain a respectful environment for everyone, which means you, must follow these basic rules of conduct:<br>
•	comply with applicable laws, including export control, sanctions, money laundering, and human trafficking laws.<br>
•	respect the rights of others, including privacy and intellectual property rights.<br>
•	don’t abuse or harm others or yourself (or threaten or encourage such abuse or harm) including against children — for example, by misleading, defrauding, illegally impersonating, defaming, bullying, harassing, or stalking others; hosting or publishing any obscene content; or inciting the violation of applicable laws.<br>
•	Don’t abuse, harm, interfere with, or disrupt the services — for example, by accessing or using them in fraudulent or deceptive ways, introducing malware, or spamming, hacking, or bypassing our systems or protective measures. When we index the web to bring you search results, we respect standard usage restrictions that website owners specify in their website's code, so we require the same when others use our services.<br>
•	Our service-specific additional terms and policies provide additional details about appropriate conduct that everyone using those services must follow. If you find that others aren't following these rules, many of our services allow you to report abuse. If we act on a report of abuse, we also provide the process described in the Taking action in case of problems section.<br><br>

<h3 class="sub-head">What's covered?</h3><br>

</p><br>

<h3 class="sub-head">What's not covered? </h3><br>
<p class="para">
    •	This license doesn’t affect your privacy rights — it’s only about your intellectual property rights.<br>
    •	This license doesn’t cover these types of content.<br>
    •	Publicly-available factual information that you provide, such as corrections to the address of a local business. That information doesn’t require a license because it’s considered common knowledge that everyone’s free to use.<br>
    •	Feedback that you offer, such as suggestions to improve our services. Feedback is covered in the Service-related communications section below.<br>
    
   
</p><br>
<h3 class="sub-head">You’re QSIPL Account</h3>   
<br>
<p class="para">
    •	If you meet these age requirements you can create a QSIPL Account for your convenience. Some services require that you have a QSIPL Account in order to work — for example, to use Gmail, you need a QSIPL Account so that you have a place to send and receive your email.<br>
    •	You’re responsible for what you do with your QSIPL Account, including taking reasonable steps to keep your QSIPL Account secure, and we encourage you to regularly use the Security Checkup.<br>
     
</p><br>
<h3 class="sub-head">Software in QSIPL services </h3>
<p class="para">Some of our services include downloadable software. We give you permission to use that software as part of the services.
    The license we give you is:<br>
    •	worldwide, which means it's valid anywhere in the world<br>
    •	non-exclusive, which means that we can license the software to others<br>
    •	royalty-free, which means there are no monetary fees for this license<br>
    •	personal, which means it doesn't extend to anyone else<br>
    •	non-assignable, which means you're not allowed to assign the license to anyone else<br>
    Some of our services include software that's offered under open source license terms that we make available to you. Sometimes there are provisions in the open source license that explicitly override parts of these terms, so please be sure to read those licenses.
    You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our services or software.
    </p>
     
    <h3 class="sub-head">Disclaimers</h3>
<p class="para">The only commitments we make about our services (including the content in the services, the specific functions of our services, or their reliability, availability, or ability to meet your needs) are provided in (1) the Warranty section; (2) the service-specific additional terms; and (3) laws that can't be limited by these terms.
    </p>

    <h3 class="sub-head">Suspending or terminating your access to QSIPL services</h3>
<p class="para">QSIPL reserves the right to suspend or terminate your access to the services or delete your QSIPL Account if any of these things happen:<br>
    •	you materially or repeatedly breach these terms, service-specific additional terms or policies.<br>
    •	we're required to do so to comply with a legal requirement or a court order.<br>
    •	we reasonably believe that your conduct causes harm or liability to a user, third party, or QSIPL — for example, by hacking, phishing, harassing, spamming, misleading others, or scraping content that doesn't belong to you.<br>
    •	For more information about why we disable accounts and what happens when we do, see this Help Center page. If you believe your QSIPL Account has been suspended or terminated in error, you can appeal.<br>
    Of course, you're always free to stop using our services at any time. If you do stop using a service, we'd appreciate knowing why so that we can continue improving our services.<br><br>
        </p>
        <h3 class="sub-head">About these terms</h3>
<p class="para">By law, you have certain rights that can't be limited by a contract like these terms of service. These terms are in no way intended to restrict those rights.<br>
    These terms describe the relationship between you and QSIPL. They don't create any legal rights for other people or organizations, even if others benefit from that relationship under these terms.<br>
    We want to make these terms easy to understand, so we've used examples from our services. But not all services mentioned may be available in your country.<br>
    If these terms conflict with the service-specific additional terms, the additional terms will govern for that service.<br>
    If it turns out that a particular term is not valid or enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.
    If you don't follow these terms or the service-specific additional terms, and we don't take action right away, that doesn't mean we're giving up any rights that we may have, such as taking action in the future.<br>
    We may update these terms and service-specific additional terms (1) to reflect changes in our services or how we do business — for example, when we add new services, features, technologies, pricing, or benefits (or remove old ones), (2) for legal, regulatory, or security reasons, or (3) to prevent abuse or harm.<br>
    If we materially change these terms or service-specific additional terms, we'll provide you with reasonable advance notice and the opportunity to review the changes, except (1) when we launch a new service or feature, or (2) in urgent situations, such as preventing ongoing abuse or responding to legal requirements. If you don't agree to the new terms, you should remove your content and stop using the services. You can also send your relationship with us at any time by closing your QSIPL Account.<br>
